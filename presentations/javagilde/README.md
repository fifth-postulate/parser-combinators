Javagilde presentation
======================

This directory contains our presentation for the Javagilde at Alliander.

The idea of this presentation is that it is a live coding demonstration, where we build a set of
parser combinators that enable us to parse a simple expression. (addition and multiplication only).

There are two roles; the narrator and the coder.

It contains two parts;
- The code; `start.kt` is our starting point and `final.kt` is the goal we are working towards, it
  serves as a place where we can peek in case we lose track.
- The `presentation.md` contains notes about where the narrator should continue and how it all fits
  together. Since the presentation is in Dutch the contents of this file are as well.
