# Parse this and then that
What we are going to combine in this chapter is two parsers with the intent of parsing with the first parser **and then** parse the remaining input with the second parser.

## Exercises
1. Create the `andThen` parser
2. If you wanted to parse more than two consecutive parsers, how would you implement that?
