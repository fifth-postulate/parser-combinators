# Parser Combinators
## Practical Parsing for Pragmatic Programmers
You are looking at the guide accompanying a workshop about [_parser combinators_][wikipedia:parser-combinator].

Parser combinators is an interesting topic that allows a developer to parse complex input into rich data-structures in a modular fashion. This form of parsing is possible in any language that supports [_higher order functions_][wikipedia:higher-order-function]. Luckily that includes a lot of languages, like Java, Python, JavaScript and many more.

We believe in learning by doing, so you can expect to be asked to open your favourite editor or integrated development environment and gain first-hand practical experience with _parser combinators_, by following along this guide. Exercises along the way help cement your new found knowledge making _parser combinators_ a valuable tool in your toolkit.
