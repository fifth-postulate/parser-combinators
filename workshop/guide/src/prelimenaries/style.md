# Style
There are various programming languages, each with their own style or [_paradigm_][wikipedia:programming-paradigm].

For this workshop it is not particularly important which style to use. The important property is that one should be able to create complex constructs from simpler building blocks.

This can be done in the _object oriented style_ by composing objects. In a _functional style_ one would compose functions.

We leave it at your own discretion how best to implement the ideas in this workshop. That does not mean that you are on your own. There is always room to discuss your ideas with other participants or with the workshop guide before commiting to a certain style.

## Exercises
1. What is your favorite programming language and what style does it use?
2. What styles do you like?
3. What style are you going to use for the workshop?
