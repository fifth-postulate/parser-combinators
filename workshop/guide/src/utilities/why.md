# It does not end here
We have created a number of basic parsers and combinators for them. But it does not end here.

Not all combinators that could come in handy are already defined. Some of them are presented in the utilities section, others are only discovered after using the parser combinator framework.

If you want to try your hand on creating other parser combinators that serve a certain purpose, stick around.

If instead you would like to use them to parse an interesting structure, take a look at the projects section.

## Time to spread your wings
In the preceding chapters there was pseudo code that provided hints on how to implement certain parser.

Now is the time to spread your wings and take to the skies without our hints. You will not find pseudo code anymore. Partly because it allows you to cement the knowledge obtained from the workshop. Partly because the pseudo code is for all intents and purposes indistinct from an actual implementation.
