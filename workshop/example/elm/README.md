# Elm
Here you find Elm examples accompanying the _Practical Parsing for Pragmatic Programmers_ workshop.

## Choices
In this project a parser is a function that accepts the input to parse.

## Development

To run all the test execute `elm-test`

### Using
To work the projects run the `elm repl` and import the specific project. E.g. to use the expression parser import

```elm
from Expression import (..)
```
