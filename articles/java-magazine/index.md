Parsing is an important tool in a developers toolbox. However, developers often use sub-par mimicries of actual parsers.

In this article we will remedy that and introduce the reader with the idea of parser combinators.

## Part one: a parser
*where our protagonists meet each other behind the keyboard*

D: Geert, what is a parser actually?
G: Glad you asked Daan! A parser is a function that transforms text into objects.

D: So this would be a good signature

```kotlin
(String) -> T
```

G: Hmmm, almost
D: What is wrong with it?
G: Well, what would you return when the you expect a number and the text is "banana"?
D: Ah, I see. We are missing the possiblity to express a failure. Would this be better?

```kotlin
(String) -> T?
```

G: Yes, this is a parser... But we can do better!
D: How?
G: What if we could combine functions with this "parser signature" in a way that they become bigger and better parsers?
D: Sounds great! How would we go about this?
G: Say a text that starts with a number, but ends with " + 12", we would like a next parser to continue where we left of. So we need a way to return this left-over text.
D: So what about this:

```kotlin
(String) -> Pair<T, String>?
```

G: Yes! Maybe we should make this official?
D: Let's do it!

```kotlin
typealias Parser<T> = (String) -> Pair<T, String>?
```

D: You said something about combining parsers?
G: I did! But maybe it would be nice if we would implement a few simple parsers? Just to play with the signature and the concept a little bit?
D: Good idea! What about a parser that parses a single 'A' from a String?
G: Yes, good one! What would you suggest?
D: I think the following does implement the Parser signature:

```kotlin
fun parseA(input: String): Pair<Char, String>? =
    if (input.startsWith('A')) {
        'A' to input.drop(1)
    } else {
        null
    }
```

G: It does! Would it not be great if you can make this more generic?
D: Do you want to accept the charcter to match? Like so

```kotlin
fun character(needle: Char): Parser<Char> = { input ->
    if (input.startsWith(needle)) {
        needle to input.drop(1)
    } else {
        null
    }
}
```
G: Yes!
D: My head hurts a little, and it's late now, lets get some rest and continue tomorrow?
G: Okay! Goodnight!

## Part two: combining parsers

G: Hi Daan, brotha from another motha, how did you sleep?
D: Wazzaap, I was thinking about parsers. You mentioned that it would be nice to combine them. How does that work?

G: Well, lets say you have a parser for an 'A' and a parser for a 'B'. You want to have a parser that parses either 'A' or 'B'.
D: That would be nice. Would this work

```kotlin
fun or(p: Parser<Char>, q: Parser<Char>): Parser<Char> = { input ->
    p(input) ?: q(input)
}
```

G: That is a good first try. But can you improve it?
D: I am not sure.
G: Take a look at the type arguments. Now it can only be used with a `Parser<Char>`.
D: I understand! Let's make it more generic

```kotlin
fun <T> or(p: Parser<T>, q: Parser<T>): Parser<T> = { input ->
    p(input) ?: q(input)
}
```

G: let's try it out

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val p = or(character('A'), character('B'))
    println(p("A"))
    println(p("B"))
    println(p("C"))
}
```

```plain
('A', "")
('B', "")
null
```

D: It works!
G: Whoop whoop!

G: If we can do `or` we can do `and`.
D: ðŸ¤¯
D: Like this?

```kotlin
fun <S, T> and(p: Parser<S>, q: Parser<T>): Parser<Pair<S, T>> = { input ->
    p(input)?.let { ( first, intermediate) ->
        q(intermediate)?.let { (second, rest) ->
            (first to second) to rest
        }
    }
}
```

G: Looking good! But the parser returns a pair, what if you want something else?
D: Can we transform it?
G: I like how you are thinking! High five!
D: I will get to it.

```kotlin
fun <S,T> map(p: Parser<S>, transform: (S) -> T): Parser<T> = { input ->
    p(input)?.let { (result, rest) -> transform(result) to rest }
}
```

G: Let's see if it works

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val p = map(and(character('A'), character('B'))) { (left, right) ->
        "$left$right"
    }
   println(p("ABC"))
}
```

```plain

```

G: What other combinators can you think of?
D: Let me see... zero or more occurences of 'A'?
G: That is a good suggestion
D: Hmm, let me think of an implementation

```kotlin
fun <T> star(p: Parser<T>): Parser<List<T>> = { input ->
    val result = p(input)
    if (result != null) {
        val (match, intermediate) = result
        val (remaining, rest) = star(intermediate)
        (match + remaining) to rest
    } else {
        emptyList() to input
    }
}
```

D: Would this work?
G: Lets see

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val p = star(character('A'))
    println(p("AAAAAB"))
}
```
