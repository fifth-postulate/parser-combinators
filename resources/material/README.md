# Workshop Material
This archive contains all the material needed for the _Practical Parsing for Pragmatic Programmers_ workshop.

It contains

1. A Guide
2. Example Code

## Guide
The guide is a collections of webpages explaining the topic by providing theory, examples, exercises and projects. You can serve the guide by creating a small webserver, e.g. by running the following code from the workshop material directory

```shell
python3 -m http.server --directory guide 26624 
```

You will find the guide at [`http://localhost:26624`](http://localhost:26624).

## Examples
Example code can be found in the `example` directory. In this directory examples are subdivided per language. I.e. if you are interested in seeing an example in Python, take a look at `example/python`.
